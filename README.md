# pick-and-place-robot-arduino
After the grand success of the Spinel Crux in the Arduino Robotics workshop, we started working on an add on, which can be placed on top the Spinel Crux – A Robotic Arm, controlled using Hand Gestures/Joystick. A pick and place robot using Arduino and a cool robotic arm, with 4 DOF(Degrees of Freedom).

Meet the Spinel Crux L2 – The Pick and Place Robot

Spinel Crux L2 is an advanced version of Spinel Crux V1. We have added a robotic arm on top of the previously built remote control gesture controlled robot which will enable the bot to pick and place objects around it.

This one is also remotely controlled and can be controlled without nasty wires hanging around.
